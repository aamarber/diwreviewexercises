Given the index.html provided, try to accomplish the next things:

1. Use bootstrap so:
    - The table uses bootstrap styles
    - The table only uses 50% of the width

2. Setup styles so the page has a "dark theme". Setup the styles in SASS code.

3. Setup a gulpfile so it transpiles the SASS code and dumps it inside the folder /dist

4. Convert the link of each product into a button that shows the product info inside a modal provided into a bootstrap navbar component

You can try to solve each part sepparately (except 2 and 3).
